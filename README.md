# pokemondatabase2025
a pokemon tcg database for collectors for my final in csi350 6/2025
pictures hate me, for some reason idk why but i cannot add imgs to this which is weird and i have spent 4 hours trying to figure it out i give up.
the wishlist feature was giving me some weird errors also, whenever i kept trying to add it in, it wouldnt save so i had to give up on that also in the end sadly.
i just did the css and navbar coding in one file simply because i was lazy and i really dont like having to many files. 
Got imgs to work but the wishlist was still giving me errors and i decide to cut it sadly.
idk why but my npm start also takes a lil bit on my pc. but the python app.py loads instantly 
Colorless", "Grass", "Fire", "Water", "Lightning",
        "Fighting", "Psychic", "Darkness", "Metal", "Dragon", "Fairy"
        these are the types for the cards all in order from 1-11 from colorless to fairy
        then surging sparks is id 1 and Destined rivals is id 2 

        {
  "name": "Slakoth",
  "hp": 60,
  "type_id": 1,
  "set_id": 1,
  "image_url": ""
}
this is how i have it laid out for postman to take the info.
